# discussion and nicely describe : https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/    with time complexity and space complexiy 
# the spacecomplexity is O(N) due to the use of the map to track nodes.
# As the loop iterates through N nodes, the total time complexity is determined by the product of the traversal (O(N)) and the average-case complexity of the hashmap operations (insert and search), resulting in O(N * 2 * log(N)). 

# Brute force solution 

# def find_inklist_loop (head):
#     temp = head
#     node_set = set()
    
#     while temp is not None:
#         if temp in node_set:
#             return True
        
#         node_set.add(temp) 
# #Insert Operation (set.add(item)):
# #Time Complexity: ùëÇ(1),O(1) on average, due to the use of a hash table.
        
#         temp = temp.next
#     return False
  
            
# optimal solution for reducing space complexity 

# The previous method uses O(N) additional memory, which can become quite large as the linked list length grows. To enhance efficiency, the Tortoise and Hare Algorithm is introduced as an optimization.
