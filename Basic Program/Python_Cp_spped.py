# 1. Use the proper algorithm and data structure 
# 2.there many build in data structure such as list , tuple,set and dictionary 
# 3.Most use List data structure and sets and dictionaries has 0(1) time complexity.
# 4.link for : data stucture complexity :https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity
# 5.Using python built in function which writen by c such as 
#   min,max,all,map ,avg

#            for word in wordlist:

# alternative for high speed  : newlist = map(str.upper, wordlist) where map function writen in case

# low spped : firstName ="Name"
#             lastName ="Henry"
#             city     ="Manchester "
# alternative for high speed  : firstName,lastname,city = "Name","Henry","Manchester"

# Prefer list comprehension over loops 
# low speed  : newlist = []
#              for i in range(1,100):

# proper import

# for lower speed : import math 
#                   value = math.sqrt(50)
# for high speed : from math import sqrt 
#                  value = sqrt(50)

# string concatenation :
#     lower speed : output = "Programmng"+"is"+"fun"
    
#     higher speed : output = " ".join(["Programming", "is","fun"])
# Tuple has more speed than list 

# As for loop is dynamic in python, it takes more time than while loop. So, use while loop instead of for loop.
# Do not use global variables because , global variaable takes high times 

# for low speed : l = []
#                 for element in set(l):
# for high speed : for element in l :
    
# donot use dot operation 
# example : for low speed : import math
#            val = math.sqrt(60)
# for high speed : from math import sqrt
#                    val = sqrt(60)
                   
# Use while 1 instead of while True 

# Try different approach :
# low speed :
# if a_condition:
#     if another_condition:
#         do_something
# else:
#     raise exception
    
# high speed :
# if (not a_condition) or (not another_condition):
#     raise exception
# do_something   

# Pypy and Numba two of them. In most of the programming contests, you will see pypy if it allows python

# If you donâ€™t have duplicate items in the collection, you need to search items repeatedly and 
# the collection contains a large number of items, then using sets and dictionaries would be the wise decision than 
# using lists. Sets and dictionaries use hash tables, so, the time complexity of each lookup is only O(1).
