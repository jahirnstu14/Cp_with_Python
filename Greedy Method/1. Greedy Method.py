# Best description of greedy method from this video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ARvQcqJ_-NY&list=PLfFeAJ-vQopt_S5XlayyvDFL_mi2pGJE3

# there are three optimization method for any problem :
    
#     1. Greedy Method
#     2. Dynamic Programming 
#     3. Branch and Bound
# #

# one problem has only one optimization solution . it can be found by greedy method or dynamic programming  or branch and bound or combining three method
